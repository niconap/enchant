      <p>
        Enchant is a CSS framework that is easy to use and is as accessible as
        possible. This documentation explains all the different elements and
        functionalities the framework has and how to use them. The framework is
        still in development, so some things may not work as intended and some
        features might be missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this framework to practice my CSS skills and to use it in my
        own web-development projects.
      </p>
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>To use the CSS framework, all you need to do is download the <code class="inline-blk">styles.css</code>
        file <a href="/styles.css" download>here</a> and add it to your project.</a></p>
      <p>Next, read the documentation to find the elements you want to use and
        add the necessary classes to your HTML elements to make it work. The
        framework comes with a font and a reset file, so you don't need to
        download those separately. However, if you want to use a different font,
        you are free to do so.
      </p>
      <h2>Customize</h2>
      <p>You can customize the colours that are used in the framework to fit your
        needs. You can do this by downloading the scss folder, changing the variables
        inside of the <code class="inline-blk">_variables.scss</code> file and compiling the scss files to css.
        Keep in mind that there are some variables that are different in dark mode
        compared to light mode.
