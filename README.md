# Enchant

Enchant is a CSS framework for building pretty, but simple looking websites. I am building this framework to improve my CSS skills and to be able to use it in my projects to all give them my personal style.

## Requirements
This CSS framework should have the following requirements:
- Responsivity
- Accessibility
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Easy to use
- Easy to customize
- Easy to extend

## How am I going to build this?
I am going to build this framework using SASS and the OOCSS and BEM methodologies. Every time I finish a component, I will add it to the framework. Every component will be documented on completion. The documentation can be found [here](https://enchant.niconap.dev/).

## Components
This framework will have the following components (this list might change):
- [x] Buttons
- [ ] Alerts
- [ ] Badges
- [ ] Cards
- [ ] Links
- [ ] Lists

## Lay-outs
This framework will have lay-outs, I have to decide which ones later.

## External code used
This framework uses the following external code/fonts:
- [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [BeVietnamPro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Be+Vietnam+Pro)
